Small Talk Trainer

Building AI course project

## Summary

Small Talk Trainer is an AI-powered tool designed to help introverts and socially anxious individuals improve their small talk and conversational flow 

## Background

Small talk is a foundational part of human connection, yet many people find it surprisingly difficult. Whether it's due to introversion, social anxiety, or unfamiliar settings like foreign countries or group gatherings, initiating and maintaining light conversations can feel awkward or intimidating. For many, especially those without much social practice, the fear of judgment or not knowing what to say often leads to avoidance, making the issue even worse over time.Small Talk Trainer was created to fill this gap. It provides a safe, judgment-free space where users can rehearse short, realistic dialogues and gradually build confidence. The tool simulates natural conversation flow and offers feedback, helping users improve not only what they say but how they say it.        

## How is it used?            

*The user selects a scenario (e.g., "Talking to a classmate", "Meeting someone at a coffee shop").  

*The AI chatbot engages in a short conversation (5–10 messages).

*After each session, the AI provides feedback on:

  Tone and emotional warmth

  How engaging or abrupt the questions were

  Suggestions for making the chat more playful, curious, or relaxed

*Users can retry with adjustments based on the feedback. 
## Data sources and AI methods

*Data: The model relies on pre-trained NLP models (like GPT-based architectures or open-source ones like DialoGPT or T5). Training data is conversational text from diverse open datasets (e.g., DailyDialog, 
 PersonaChat).

Natural Language Processing (NLP): For understanding and generating human-like conversation.

Sentiment Analysis: To assess the emotional tone of the user’s messages.

Conversational Flow Modeling: To identify pauses, awkward transitions, or overly direct responses.

Feedback Engine: A simple rule-based or ML classifier to provide real-time suggestions. 

## Challenges

*WMay not fully capture cultural differences or subtle cues in communication.

*Feedback system is not perfect—especially around sarcasm, humor, or emotional nuance.

*Not intended for clinical therapy use.


## What next?

*Add voice interaction to simulate real-time spoken conversations.

*Include personalization features (e.g., user style tracking over time).

*Integrate emotion detection via webcam or microphone for more feedback.

*Allow multi-language support for global users.
